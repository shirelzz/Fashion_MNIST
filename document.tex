\section{Abstract}
In this report, we present a study on implementing a neural network model for the classification of fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset.\\
We compare the performance of the neural network approach with traditional machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).\\
The report discusses the project methodology, experimental results, and conclusions drawn from the comparison.
